  calibration:
    # The ranging mode is different based on how long the distance is that the sensor need to measure.
    # The longer the distance, the more time the sensor needs to take a measurement.
    # Available options are: auto, shortest, short, medium, long, longer, longest
    ranging: auto

  # Smooth out measurements by using the minimum distance from this number of readings
  sampling: 2
  # This controls the size of the Region of Interest the sensor should take readings in.
  roi: { height: 16, width: 6 }
  # The detection thresholds for determining whether a measurement should count as a person crossing.
  # A reading must be greater than the minimum and less than the maximum to count as a crossing.
  # These can be given as absolute distances or as percentages.
  # Percentages are based on the automatically determined idle or resting distance.
  detection_thresholds: # defaults for both zones. These also default to 0% & 85% as previously done.
    # min: 234mm # absolute distance
    max: 85% # percent based on idle distance
  # The people counting algorithm works by splitting the sensor's capability reading area into two zones.
  # This allows for detecting whether a crossing is an entry or exit based on which zones was crossed first.
